# Human Computer Interaction Course Project

This repository contains the project developed for the Human Computer Interaction course. The project is a web-based system designed to facilitate users in searching for courses at Sapienza University.

## Project Idea

The main idea for the project is to provide a simple and intuitive user interface for accessing detailed information about university courses. The system uses a "tag-based" system to refine searches and suggest courses that align with the user's interests. Each course has associated information to help users discover its most important aspects.

## Final Implementation

Throughout the development of the project, the idea was expanded to include user reviews and suggestions for course information, such as course tags. Additional features were introduced after the user requirements gathering phase, such as course comparison and user login for managing courses of interest.

For the first working version of the system, the scope was restricted to include courses from Sapienza University. However, the database and its contained information, as well as the system's interface and functionalities, were designed to be as general and modular as possible to allow for scalability.
